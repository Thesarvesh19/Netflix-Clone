# Netflix-Clone
I built a Netflix-clone using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's a static, responsive UI available in English, Bengali, French, and Spanish. A key feature is a genre-based sorting algorithm that dynamically filters shows. This project demonstrates my skills in creating a visually appealing and interactive front-end.
